Admin Panel Prompt for a Logistics Platform
Design a complete, responsive, and clean Admin Panel Dashboard (inspired by Trackon.in) for a logistics platform with the following features:

ü™ô Currency
All monetary values should be in Indian Rupees (INR ‚Çπ) across the entire system, including invoices and UI components.

üîê Partner Login System
Create a Partner Login Page with:

Fields: Email / Partner ID and Password

Validations with loader animation

Error message:
"‚ùå Invalid credentials. Please check your partner login details."

Include "Forgot Password" and Resend Login Access functionality

üì¶ Booking Page
A booking form with fields for:

Sender & Receiver details

Pickup and Delivery State

Package weight, type, and dimensions

Automatically calculate charges based on admin-configured pricing (see below)

Auto bill generation like eBay checkout:

Show live breakdown: Base fare, extra weight cost, CGST, SGST, IGST, discounts

All in INR ‚Çπ

Allow PDF Download / Print of the generated invoice using jspdf or html2pdf.js

‚öôÔ∏è Admin Customization Panel
Let the admin configure pricing and availability dynamically:

State/Zone Management

Add/Edit/Delete States or Delivery Zones

Set per-state Pickup Availability and Base Pickup Rates

Weight-Based Pricing Logic

Admin can set:

Minimum Billable Weight (MBW) (e.g., 2 kg)

Base Pickup Charge (e.g., ‚Çπ100 for 2kg)

Extra charge per kg beyond MBW (e.g., ‚Çπ30/kg after 2 kg)

System should dynamically calculate charges based on these rules

Must allow easy editing from UI

Real-Time Preview

Any change in pricing or state config should show a live preview of billing calculations on a sample booking

üßæ Bill Generation & Invoice Management
Admin can:

View all bookings

Select booking(s) to generate GST-compliant invoices

Edit: tax fields, discounts, remarks

Export data in CSV / Excel

Generate QR code / tracking link on invoices

üíª Tech Stack Recommendation
Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js (Express) + MongoDB or Firebase

Utilities: jspdf, html2pdf.js, xlsx, optional QR code generator

This panel should be simple, fast, mobile-responsive, and customizable for real logistics business use.

Would you like me to generate the code for any specific module now (e.g., booking form, invoice generator, partner login, admin pricing config)?
